# Multimodal Evaluation

## Requirements

This repo requires the [visual genome python api](https://github.com/ranjaykrishna/visual_genome_python_driver)
to be installed. Additionally, it only works with locally downloaded data (see the corresponding [README](https://github.com/ranjaykrishna/visual_genome_python_driver#the-local-functions-are-listed-below)
on how to download and process the files, the `save_scene_graphs_by_id` function needs to be run to 
save make the scene graphs accessible by ID).
